##                    **Definition**   
***I Think You Heard "Vulnerability/Bug" Name Before Right?***    
***But Did You Ask Yourself That How Vulnerability Found? Let Me Expain That Thing For You***
    
**EXP:**    
***Imagine That There Are A Thief Trying To Steal A Shop , So To Steal The Shop He Have To Understand Everything About The (Build,Location,Vault) So After Understood That Thing He Will Be Able To Steal The Shop(EXP)***   
**Conc:**   
***To Stell The Systems "Safty" You Have To Understand Everything About It And That Proccess Called "Expolit Dev"***    
***So Lets Talk Now About The Exploit Dev Deeply, So That Title Explain 'Vuln Founders Way'***    
##**Vulnerability**     
***Exploit(N): Mean, An Unlogic Action That Happen By Some Error's In System Or Problem In Source Code Like (Sqli,Rce,XSS,Etc..)***     
***Exploit(V):That Mean , The Things That You Have To Do To Apply A Vuln(Attack Code//Payload)***    
### ***So How?***    
## **Step 1**     
***To Found Vuln You Have To Understand A lot Of Things Like (Vuln's_Type,System_Arch's,OS's,System's_Ver,Etc...) After Understood That Things You Will Move To Second Step...***     
## **Step 2**
***You Have To Understand How Others Vuln Found(Like: Xss Founder Found That Vuln Because He Note That The Html Compiler Dosent Filtter Any Input ....)***    
## **Xss**   
***As I Said Html Compiler Dosent Filtter Any Input So If We Add An Code In The Input With End Mark For The Input Code Compiler Will Work With The Input As Clear HTML Code***
```
#!/usr/Html
<form>
  <label for="fname">Anything:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
### **Output:**   
![alt text](https://k.top4top.io/p_24415mqe41.png)    
***So What Will Happend If We Tried Write An Html Code ?***    
***The Compiler Will Think That Input Is A Html Code Because There Are No Speciality For Strings In HTML That Mean You Can Enter Any Thing In Input Section Or Any String In Code Section(body Sec...)***
## **Step 3**   
***After Found The Vuln You Have To Write Your Exploit For That Vuln (Beacuse In Some Cases To Exploit Vuln You Have To APPLY Multi Vuln's ) The Exploit Must Include How To Apply Your Vuln + Expalin***
## **Step 4**    
***After Writing You Have To Start Testing.. Try Your Vuln On Multi Arch, OS***
## **Step 5**
***After Finishing Everything You Have To Start Your Way To Fix The Vuln That Step Is Recommended***
## **Memory Vuln**   
***Sometimes You Will Find The Vuln In Vuln (After Compiling) That Type Of Vuln's Called 'Inject V' That Type Is Available In Compiler Vuln 2 But Its More Logical Than Mem V Like To Exploit That Type You Have To Find A Error In Converter(Compiler'50%')(Input=>Machine Language) So ILL Go Deeply In Next Parts***     
### I'll Share Roadmap For That Title AsSoonAsPossible
